# Kubernetes

## Pod
- A pod is like the smallest possible unit in the k8s world where we can define in some configuration files where the k8s can create.
- A pod simply holds a container or multiple containers.
- These pods with the containers run inside the worker node, which runs the containers of applications.
- Nodes are like the machines /virtual instances like EC2 instances.
- Proxy/Config configures the network and external traffic.
- We can have different or equal container running on multiple worker nodes with load distributed equally.
- Master Node (Control Pane) interact with the worker nodes and controls them.
- All of these forms a cluster.
